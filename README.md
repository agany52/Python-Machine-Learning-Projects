Alec Gany's Python & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as a collection of my data analytics and machine learning projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning to solve real-world problems.

As a problem-solver with a strong foundation in Applied Mathematics, I am passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights. Please feel free to explore the projects below.

📈 Projects

Lab Instrument QC Anomaly Detector

An end-to-end machine learning project that simulates and automatically detects anomalies in lab instrument data using an unsupervised Isolation Forest model. This demonstrates skills in data simulation, anomaly detection, and hyperparameter tuning.

Titanic Survival Prediction

A classic supervised learning project focused on data cleaning, feature engineering, and building a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival. This demonstrates foundational data science skills in classification and data preparation.
