🫀 Heart Disease Risk Predictor

A machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on 13 clinical features. Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit.

🎯 Project Goal

To build a diagnostic tool that prioritizes clinical safety (high Recall) over raw accuracy. As a phlebotomist transitioning into data science, I recognized that in a medical screening context, a False Negative (missing a sick patient) is far worse than a False Positive.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Model: Random Forest Classifier (Optimized for Recall)

App: Streamlit (Web Interface)

Data Processing: Pandas & NumPy

Validation: 5-Fold Cross-Validation

🧠 Key Features

Recall Optimization: The model's decision threshold was tuned from 0.5 to 0.3. This improved the detection of sick patients (Recall) from 75% to 90%.

Data Leakage Fix: Identified and removed ~700 duplicate rows from the original UCI dataset that were artificially inflating accuracy scores to 99%.

Interactive UI: Allows clinicians to input vitals (BP, Cholesterol, EKG) and receive real-time risk assessments.

🚀 How to Run Locally

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit joblib


Run the app:
